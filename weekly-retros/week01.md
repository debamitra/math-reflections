# Getting Started

## Highlights:
- Deepened understanding of slope and functions
- Resisted perfectionism — published daily even when tired
- Noticed that visual thinking helps me retain concepts

## Challenges:
- Managing energy across work + writing
- Avoiding shallow summaries — slowing down helped

## Focus for Week 2:
- Dive into algebraic manipulation (factoring, simplification)
- Introduce 1 visual or real-world link per post
- Keep reflections between 150–250 words

# 📘 Day 1 – Slope as Change Per Unit

🧩 **Concept:**  
Slope is often introduced as "rise over run." But today I reframed it as the *rate of change normalized* over a constant — "per 1 unit of x."

🔍 **Insight:**  
It’s not about steepness — it’s about *relationship*. If slope is 0, it’s stability. If it’s undefined, it’s disruption.

✏️ **Reflection:**  
This helped me understand linearity not just as a line, but as *dependability*. There’s a psychological comfort in knowing y increases predictably with x.
